# LSTM Kalman Filters
PyTorch LSTMs for state estimation of dynamical systems. Test systems include 1) spring-mass-damper, 2) cantilever beam, 3) randomly generated LTI system. Also includes parallelized Kalman filter implementation for each system.
Generate data by running one of the KF notebooks. For spring-mass-dampers, degrees of freedom can be adjusted.
